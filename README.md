# node-express-app
boilerplate for node express backend to make my life simpler
These are dependences and set up I personally use for my backend set ups
I will include a users and post migration with seeds.
It will also include the routers, models and middleware.
I'll also make a how to and what needs to be changed to customize for your project.

this boilerplate uses {bcryptjs, cors, dotenv, express, helmet, jsonwebtoken, knex, sqlite}
nodemon is on there as a dev dependency and postgres is installed for productions.

once the folder is downloaded run yarn install in the root of your folder and you can use yarn server to start up the server
